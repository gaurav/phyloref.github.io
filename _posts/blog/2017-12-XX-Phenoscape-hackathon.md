Gaurav and Guanyang attended a the Phenoscape Knowledgebase Hackathon hosted by Duke University. The Hackathon was named ["Promoting Phenoscape KB Data Access and Interoperability Codefest, 2017"](https://github.com/phenoscape/KB-DataFest-2017). It was sponsored by [Phenoscape](http://phenoscape.org/), which is an informatics project that aims to  "create a scalable infrastructure that enables linking phenotypes across different fields of biology by the semantic similarity of their descriptions". The [goal](https://hackmd.io/s/Sk6Xa7Eq-#) of this Hackathon was to "bring together a diverse group of people to collaboratively design and work hands-on on targets of their interest that take advantage and promote reuse of Phenoscapeâ€™s online evolutionary data resources and services". Altogether [28 researchers](https://github.com/phenoscape/KB-DataFest-2017/wiki/Participants) participated in this Hackathon. This group included both domain experts (meaning organismal biologists or taxonomists in this particular workshop) and programmers. 

The Hackathon was a great success and also a good experience for Guanyang and Gaurav. Among the many factors that contributed to its success, we will describe just a few things that were especially impressive and inspiring. We liked the [Open Space Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) used at the workshop. This happened at the beginning of Hackathon, where participants stood up and gave a three-minute pitch to the audience about a topic that they would like to pursue. Audidence was asked to ask questions that will promote better understanding of the proposal, but not challenge the validity of it. More than 10 pitches were given and written down on easel pad stickers (like [this](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Post-it-Super-Sticky-Self-Stick-Tabletop-Easel-Pad-20-x-23-White-20-Sheets-Pad/15074488)), which were pasted on walls all around the meeting room. Participants then gathered around the topic that interested them and discussed with the pictch-maker or the leader of the proposed project. I (Guanyang) was interested the [PhyloPheno] (https://github.com/phenoscape/PhyloPheno) pitch (see details below) and Gaurav [insert XXX]. The second aspect of the Hackathon that was really important was the opportunity to interact with other researchers, both during the working and informal, social events (coffee breaks or dinning time). I was able to chat with most of the participants and also talked about our phyloreferencing project with several. It was interesting, and in some way, stimulating, to get different reactions about this project or more generally about taxonomy from other participants. While most lamented on the instability of names, but some also remarked that taxonomic names really aren't something they want to be bothered with. The latter sentiment represents perhaps quite a good number of biologists, who may see taxonomy or nomenclature as non-science (See [Dubois 2005, p. 367](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiv_rzSsqPYAhUQ3mMKHfjWBKsQFggoMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsciencepress.mnhn.fr%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Farticles%2Fpdf%2Fz2005n2a8.pdf&usg=AOvVaw0gLpRY92Qjh2uvLkbwc2NYkjgzz)). Besides getting different viewpoints of taxonomy, I also learned some neat techniques during the workshop, such as making reproducible graphics with Ruby ([an example](https://github.com/phenoscape/fishtank/blob/master/doc/viz.png) by Matt Yoder) and using [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) to run an R script interactively in a web interface. The third thing that really struck me is how an intially coarse idea could be quickly developed into an actual project and in some teams even transformed into a substantial product such as the [Phenomap demo R package](https://github.com/phenoscape/KB-DataFest-2017-linking-data/tree/master/phenomap). Gaurav [insert XXX. If you wish, please describe maybe one or two other apsects of the hackathon that you liked.]

Guanyang joined the PhenoPhylo(https://github.com/phenoscape/PhyloPheno) team, led by [Emily McTavish](https://mctavishlab.github.io/). This team worked on a small project to match [Vertebrate Taxonomy Ontology (VTO)](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/VTO) ([Midford et al., 2013](https://jbiomedsem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2041-1480-4-34)) with the [Open Tree Taxonomy (OTT)](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/about/taxonomy-version/ott3.0). The VTO is used in the Phenoscape Knowledge database as its underlying taxonomy. It contains more than 100,000 taxonomic names compiled from multiple sources.

Updating and provonance 

Why is ther a need to match the two taxonomies, namely, VTO and OTT? Phenoscape contains trait (phenotypic) data, anchored to taxonomic names and  comparative analyses require phylogenetic trees.

Throughout the four-day workshp, a recurring theme is reconciling taxonomies.

[Matt Yoder](http://wwx.inhs.illinois.edu/directory/show/mjyoder) (Illinois Natural History Survey) demonstrated the nomenclature model of [Taxonworks](http://taxonworks.org/), which is an all-in-one biodiversity/taxonomic data management system. I was particularly impressed with the elegant and user-friendly sandbox interface. Further details about the nomenclature ontology in Taxonworks can be found in the [abstract](https://biss.pensoft.net/article/20284/) and [slides](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/nomen/blob/master/docs/presentations/Ballroom_A_Tuesday_1445_Yoder_TDWG17.pptx) of a talk given by Matt at [TDWG 2017](https://tdwg.github.io/conferences/2017/)
