The first[^postdocs] postdoc we planned to recruit plays a central
role in this project. We anticipated the incumbent to take part in
every key area of the project, from software development, to research,
to coordinating with related bioinformatics efforts, and in
outreach. Recruiting this role proved very challenging and took the
better part of a year. As you might imagine, we are therefore thrilled
to announce that effective June 15, 2016, [Gaurav Vaidya] has joined
our project.

Gaurav has spent the last five years as a graduate student at the
University of Colorado Boulder in [Rob Guralnick's lab], where he
developed techniques and measures to quantify taxonomic stability,
which is important for those integrating data for taxa. He also enjoys
building software tools for biodiversity researchers, and in his spare
time he has been editing Wikipedia articles since 2002. All of which
means that he is a perfect fit for the role we were looking to fill.

Gaurav has jumped into Phyloreferencing right at the deep end of the
pool. Within days he [presented the semantic clade concept](https://speakerdeck.com/gaurav/the-semantic-clade),
an idea fundamental to the project, at the 2016 Evolution Meetings in
Austin, TX. Thanks to most talks at this year's Evolution Meetings
having been taped, you can [watch his talk on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aNaAQYTNVc).

For the next several months Gaurav will split his time between
Phyloreferencing and finishing up his PhD, and we expect he'll be able
to join us as a full time postdoc in the beginning of 2017. 

Please join us in welcoming Gaurav!

[^postdocs]: The [original proposal](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1401984) mentions only one postdoc. NSF agreed to fund a second postdoc to allow a more substantive interaction with large clade-oriented research projects, specifically [GoLife](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5129)-funded projects. More about that soon.
