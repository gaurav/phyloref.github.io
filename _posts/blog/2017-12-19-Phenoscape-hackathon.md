Gaurav and Guanyang attended a the Phenoscape Knowledgebase Hackathon hosted by Duke University. The hackathon was named ["Promoting Phenoscape KB Data Access and Interoperability Codefest, 2017"](https://github.com/phenoscape/KB-DataFest-2017). It was sponsored by [Phenoscape](http://phenoscape.org/), which is an informatics project that aims to  "create a scalable infrastructure that enables linking phenotypes across different fields of biology by the semantic similarity of their descriptions". The [goal](https://hackmd.io/s/Sk6Xa7Eq-#) of this hackathon was to "bring together a diverse group of people to collaboratively design and work hands-on on targets of their interest that take advantage and promote reuse of Phenoscapeâ€™s online evolutionary data resources and services". Altogether [28 researchers](https://github.com/phenoscape/KB-DataFest-2017/wiki/Participants) with diverse domain expertise participated in this hackathon. 

The Hackathon was a great success and also a good experience for Guanyang and Gaurav. Among the many factors that contributed to its success, we will described just a few things that were especially impressive and inspiring. We liked the [Open Space Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) used at the workshop. This happened at the beginning of Hackathon, where participants stood up and gave a three-minute pitch to the audience about a topic that they would like to pursue. Audidence was asked to ask questions that will promote better understanding of the proposal, but not challenge the validity of it. More than 10 pitches were given and written down on easel pad stickers (like [this](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjlqsT1q6PYAhVW5WMKHRIJBpYQjRwIBw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2Fpost-itreg-tabletop-easel-pad-20-x-23-unruled-plain-white-ea-563r%2Fproduct_428893&psig=AOvVaw0MZYcV4x2Y_S7CiDI_PGZ5&ust=1514228768317176)), and then participants 

Guanyang joined the [OpenTree](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/) sub-group, led by [Emily McTavish](https://mctavishlab.github.io/) and worked on a small project to match [Vertebrate Taxonomy Ontology (VTO)](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/VTO) ([Midford et al., 2013](https://jbiomedsem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2041-1480-4-34)) with the [Open Tree Taxonomy (OTT)](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/about/taxonomy-version/ott3.0). The VTO is used in Phenoscape Knowledge as its underlying taxonomy. It contains more than 100,000 taxonomic names compiled from multiple sources. 

Why is ther a need to match the two taxonomies, namely, VTO and OTT? Phenoscape contains trait (phenotypic) data, anchored to taxonomic names and  comparative analyses require phylogenetic trees.

Throughout the four-day workshp, a recurring theme is reconciling taxonomies.

[Matt Yoder](http://wwx.inhs.illinois.edu/directory/show/mjyoder) (Illinois Natural History Survey) demonstrated the nomenclature model of [Taxonworks](http://taxonworks.org/), which is an all-in-one biodiversity/taxonomic data management system. I was particularly impressed with the elegant and user-friendly sandbox interface. Further details about the nomenclature ontology in Taxonworks can be found in the [abstract](https://biss.pensoft.net/article/20284/) and [slides](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/nomen/blob/master/docs/presentations/Ballroom_A_Tuesday_1445_Yoder_TDWG17.pptx) of a talk given by Matt at [TDWG 2017](https://tdwg.github.io/conferences/2017/)
