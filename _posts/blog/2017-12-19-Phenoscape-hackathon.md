Gaurav and Guanyang attended a phenotype ontology hackathon hosted by Duke University. The hackathon was named ["Promoting Phenoscape KB Data Access and Interoperability Codefest, 2017"](https://github.com/phenoscape/KB-DataFest-2017). It was sponsored by [Phenoscape] (http://phenoscape.org/). This is an informatics project that aims to  "create a scalable infrastructure that enables linking phenotypes across different fields of biology by the semantic similarity of their descriptions". The [goal](https://hackmd.io/s/Sk6Xa7Eq-#) of this hackathon was to "bring together a diverse group of people to collaboratively design and work hands-on on targets of their interest that take advantage and promote reuse of Phenoscapeâ€™s online evolutionary data resources and services".
