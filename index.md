  <h2 class="post-title badge">The problem</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">The vast amount of data on life's
  biodiversity that scientists collect across the globe becomes truly
  powerful only when data from all the different sources can be
  integrated, queried, and aggregated with precision by
  machines. However, the by far most common way to link organismal
  data, using taxon names based in Linnaean nomenclature, is
  fundamentally fraught. The semantics of a Linnaean name, crucial to
  determine the organisms it does and does not refer to, change over time, are
  applied inconsistently, and most importantly, are unavailable to
  machines. And the explosion of molecular data has uncovered many
  groups, not only microbial, that do not and may never have a
  Linnaean name.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title badge">Our approach</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">We use ontologies and OWL (a formal
  ontology language developed by the W3C) to enable users to create
  definitions with precise, unambiguous, and fully computable
  semantics for any organismal clade. We call such definitions
  <em>phyloreferences</em>, in analogy to
  <em>georeferences</em>, which have enabled
  countless geo-enabled applications. We employ machine reasoners to
  determine which elements in a phylogeny match a phyloreference.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title badge">What we do</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">We are developing the OWL ontologies, OWL
  data models, and tooling infrastructure needed to put our approach
  into practice, and to validate that it works correctly and
  scalably. We will also develop web applications that allow users to
  create, find, and reuse phyloreferences, and to apply them
  to phylogenies both small and Tree of Life-scale, for the purpose of
  integrating biodiversity data of interest. To accomplish this, we
  will be working with other biodiversity e-Science projects
  (including <a href="http://opentreeoflife.org" target="_blank">Open
  Tree of Life</a> and the <a href="http://eol.org"
  target="_blank">Encyclopedia of Life</a>) as well
  as large organismal research collaborations.</p>
